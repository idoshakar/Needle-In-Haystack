                "Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.",

                "At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.",
                "For the toppings: Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.",
                "Meanwhile, melt butter in a light-colored skillet over medium heat. Add onions and a generous pinch of salt and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often until onions are deeply caramelized, about 40 minutes. As the onions cook, you may need to add water, 1/4 cup at a time, to keep the onions from burning. After 40 minutes, onions should be deeply browned and jammy in consistency. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.",

Remove to a cooling rack; let cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then cut and serve.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n John Mitzewich\n\n Chef's Note\nThe bottom of the pizza should be golden brown and crisp, but if it is not, place back on sheet pan, and place over a medium high flame, until you can hear the crust start to sizzle slightly. Rotate the pan so all parts of the bottom crust get toasted and turn golden brown. This is a great way to crisp up a crust, but be careful not to go too far and burn the dough."
