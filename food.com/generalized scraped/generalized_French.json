If it is too dry to press a handful together, stir in more water. Press dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Flatten slightly and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until firm.\n\n Recipe Tip\nThe pastry can be made and kept chilled up to 3 days in advance.",
                "To make the frangipane: Cream butter and ½ cup of sugar together in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until light and soft. Gradually mix in an egg and remaining egg yolk one at a time. Stir in apple brandy. Stir 2 tablespoons of flour into ground almonds, then mix into batter. Set aside.",

Unfold dough, and press into the bottom and up the sides. Prick with a fork all over, and flute the edges. Return pastry to the refrigerator to chill until firm.",

Each slice should have one edge pressed into the frangipane until it touches the pastry base, and then overlap the previous slice. Start at the outside edge, and work towards the center.",

Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for another 10 minutes, then sprinkle sugar over the top of the tart. Return to the oven until the sugar caramelizes slightly, about 10 minutes more.",
                "Cool the tart on a wire rack. A short time before serving, warm the apricot jelly; add some water if necessary to make it a liquid consistency. Brush warm jelly over the tart for a nice shine."

A mix of green, white, and black peppercorns is nice, but not necessary.An internal temperature of 120 degrees F (50 degrees C), gives a nice medium-rare steak. If you prefer less rare, add about a minute of cooking time to each side. You may need to reduce the heat of the skillet even more, to avoid burning."

Using a wooden spoon, slowly mix in the warm milk and the warm water until the mixture forms into a pliable dough. Cover and put the dough in a warm place, until it has nearly doubled in size.",

Return the chilled dough to your floured work surface and roll it into a rectangular shape, around 50cm X 20cm - 20\" X 8\".",

Then take your rolling pin and press the dough at intervals to seal the dough and create air pockets. Roll out into a rectangle again, the same size, and then continue as before, two more times until your butter is used up - please see photos as a guide. It is important to return the rolled dough to the fridge in between each rolling to ensure the butter does not melt and the dough does not become too sticky. After the last rolling when all the butter is used, return the dough to the refrigerator to chill for a further 30 minutes.",
