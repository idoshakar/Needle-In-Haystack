                "Note: Since originally posting this recipe, I have tried some of the suggestions others have made.  I do like it with a bit of sesame oil (be careful not to get too much, just a few drops at the end of cooking is good enough for me, but you might like more), fresh ginger is also good if you have it on hand.  I have tried it with garlic and it is good that way also.  I have also found that it is good with shrimp and pork. Basically what I am trying to say is, the original recipe is just a simple, quick and healthy meal I came up with when I was craving Chinese food.  I thought it turned out really great and wanted to share it.  I'm happy that so many of you have enjoyed it. For those of you that didn't care for it, I hope you can find one that suits your fancy some where else."

It is very important to boil the chicken very slowly over low flame.Turn of flame and cover the pot. Allow the chicken to steep inside for another 20-25 minutes. Remove chicken and immerse it into a basin of cold water for 5-6 minutes.Take chicken out and drain in a colander to drip dry before cutting it into serving pieces.",

Add in the ginger and garlic and fry well (without burning the garlic) Remove and discard the chicken fat and skin. Add in the rice that has been dried and salt and stir fry briskly about 1 - 2 minutes.Transfer rice into an electric rice cooker or pot. Add in the chicken broth from the boiled chicken together with the screwpine leaves if using.If cooking in a pot, cook over low flame stirring occasionally so as not to let the bottom of the rice burn.Boil until rice is cook.",
                "While the rice is cooking, you can prepare the chilli garlic sauce. Just add all ingredients into a blender or food processor, and give it a good whizz, until ingredients are well blended. Adjust the seasoning with more salt or sugar to taste.The chili garlic sauce can be kept in the refrigerator for about 2-3 days only.",

                "Lastly combine all the ingredients for the chicken sauce and pour it all over the cut up chicken. You can add more soya sauce and chicken broth to the chicken if you prefer. Just adjust the taste of the sauce with soya sauce and chicken broth.If you do not have garlic oil,you can fry a few cloves of garlic in oil for few minutes then take out oil and garlic pour it into a jar, and let the garlic steep inside the oil.",
